So here is what I have gathered in getting started with Github and the Github shell.
Just so you know all I am about to say is to be done in the Gitshell. I noticed it doesnt seem to work in the normal command line.


Anyways, after opening the Gitshell you are taken straight into your master folder into which all shit happens.
Mine is C:\Users\USE\Documents\Github>

Now you want to get access to your Github account online so you type in the exact repository url after the comman 'git clone'.
More precisely, I would type  "git clone https://github.com/DavidWired/OnCourse

"dir" tells you now what is in Github folder online.

Of course I need to get into folders inside the Github folder so I need to use 'cd' to get in. Mind you "cd .." takes you a step back.
For instance "cd Testing123" gets me inside Testing123.

Now assuming I did any work I want to put up there I first have to save it in the Github folder of my choosing on my computer. This does not mean that it
automatically appears online. After saving it in the folder and getting into the master document "git status" shows me that particular file in
 red thus meaning it is not online. We need to add it boy!!

Type "git add documentname.extension" (e.g git add ProgressReport.tex) to put it up there.
After this typing 'git status' shows the file in green. Halleluyah.

Now you want to add a commit to it to show say what changes occured so 'git commit -m Another edit of the project'
Finally 'git push' puts all that you have done up there.
